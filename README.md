### Database Application

In this project, I designed and created database according to the normalization standard using SQLAlchemy.
Fictious data are inserted to mimic the setting. Queries are also provided to produce a monthly report according to the requirement.

*Execution (Python):* 
```
python3 -m venv .venv\ 
source .venv/bin/activate\ 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt\ 
python3 create.py\ 
python3 insert_data.py\ 
python3 query_data.py
```
